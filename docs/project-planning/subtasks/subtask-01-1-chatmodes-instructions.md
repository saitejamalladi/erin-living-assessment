# Subtask 1.1: Create Chatmodes and Instructions

## Description
Create the chatmodes and instructions files as referenced in the implementation plan. This includes defining chat modes for different development roles and providing GitHub-specific instructions to guide the development process.

## Tasks
- Create `chatmode-pr.md` in the `docs/project-planning/` directory with definitions for chat modes (Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Document Writer, Tester, DevOps/Deployment Specialist).
- Create or update `github-instructions.md` in the `docs/project-planning/` directory with GitHub workflow guidelines, including PR creation, branch management, and collaboration rules.
- Ensure the files align with the overall project structure and implementation plan.

## Git Workflow
- Create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/subtask-01-1-chatmodes-instructions`
- Commit changes with brief messages, e.g.:
  - "Add chatmode-pr.md"
  - "Add github-instructions.md"
- Before raising PR: Ensure files are properly formatted and linked in the implementation plan.
- Raise PR to main with title "Add chatmodes and instructions" and description "Create chatmode-pr.md and github-instructions.md for development guidance."
